You are stronger than you think, and it's okay to feel lost sometimes. You’re on a path that is YOUR path, and while it might seem overwhelming, remember that every step you take—no matter how small—brings you closer to your dream.

It’s okay to have bad days. It’s okay to feel like everything is too much. What matters is that you keep going, even when it’s hard. You don’t have to do everything at once. Take things one step at a time.

<h2>Your plan:</h2>
         </nav>


<div>Bachelor’s in Software Engineering</div>
— laying the foundation for a strong career.
<div>Master’s in AI or Cybersecurity  </div>— diving into the future and growing your skills.
You’re building the future you want, one choice at a time.

    Remember that feeling overwhelmed doesn’t mean you can’t succeed. Your worth isn’t measured by how many things you accomplish in a day. It's okay to pause, breathe, and take care of yourself. Progress is still progress, no matter how slow it feels.

    You are doing enough. You are enough. Take one moment at a time, and when it feels too heavy, give yourself the space to rest, heal, and refocus. You have so much potential and strength inside of you, and your future is bright. Keep believing in it, even when it feels hard.
    
    You’ve got this. Insha’Allah, everything will fall into place, and you’ll get through this stronger than ever.
